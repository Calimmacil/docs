As some of you might have noticed we revamped the docs site to make it more functional and easier to navigate.

Some of the changes: 

- Light/dark theme
- Search
- GitHub comments under news articles
- Showing the creation/update GitHub date and contributos at the end of the pages.

We are adding a RSS feed and JSON feed support, so you can subscribe via your reader of choice to stay better informed. There are 2 feeds. One is for newly created pages, another one for updated pages.
