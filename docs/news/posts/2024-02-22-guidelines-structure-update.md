With more and more new users joining in and starting to contribute, this is a perfect time to hopefully make the guidelines more readable and easier to follow.

<!-- more -->

Notable changes: 

- Each guideline page now has section that explicitly states mandatory details. 
- **Platforms** were renamed to **Networks**.[^1]
- While the guidelines remain the same, the wording of some of them was changed. 

Until now, I have been more lenient with small mistakes like missing aliases, improper images or defunct links and fixing them myself after approving them. But at the current pace it is becoming too much work, so I will be enforcing the guidelines more strictly now. 

So please take a minute and review the updated guidelines to re-familiarize yourself.
