# Studios

## Naming Conventions

1. No adding of new networks (aka unattached studios).  
2. New studios must have an existing network selected.
3. Use `username (network)` format for the studio name.  
    1. `username` is the part used in the link or after `@`. Not the display name.
    2. Do not include `@` symbol for the name.
4. Preserve the official capitalization of usernames. 
5. Network name should match the spelling used in FansDB.  
6. No abbreviations for the studio or network names.

## Link Requirements

1. All studio entries must contain a link from the approved platform.
    1. For defunct links please include proof that the account existed in the submission comment. It can be a screenshot of a watermark or 1st party post to performer linking to or promoting that account.  
2. No other links should be added to the studio. 

## Images

1. Banner images from platforms should contain some text and not just a plain image of the performer to be acceptable.
2. User generated logos or composed images are allowed.
3. Consider using unique images for studios if the performer distributes on multiple platforms.

## Multiple Accounts

1. Performers that use multiple platforms or accounts should have separate studio for each of them.
2. Removed or renamed accounts should also have a separate studio.
